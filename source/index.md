# mattborn.github.io

I made this so I could keep track of everything else I am making on Github. It serves as a repository for everything from capturing ideas to recurring stack configurations and deployment workflows via static markdown posts.

## Content ideas

Site features + URLs.

- **/writes** - Alias for /blog.
- **/makes** – Alias for /work.
- **/likes** – A whitelist/blacklist project for making categorized lists and recommendations. Alias for /recommends.
- **/captures** – Alias for /photos.
- **/splashes** – A collection of splash pages through the years.
- **/sells** – Things I want to sell. Borrowed from [Mig](http://mig.io).

## Stack notes

- Pages and posts should live no deeper than a single subdirectory.
- Each page or post should be accessible by no more than 2 URL segments.
e.g. mattborn.com/makes/hatch
- Each page or post should be able to include a custom.css or custom.js, but such files should not be required.
- For JS libraries, either A.) use a single vendor.js or B.) enable each page or post to include a custom vendor stack.
