# Gists

## [Menu, Pages + Dialogs UI](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn/251d5e9fa2ac422b1940)

Experimental responsive web interface I spent the past 2 days building to solve some issues I have having with another project.

I want to add basic states (working, empty, and fail) and explore adding support for any number of pages in series.
