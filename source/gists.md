# Gists

## [Bands.](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn/6351a34d29250ecd4519)

An initial stab at prototyping [the music project](http://mattborn.github.io/media/#music) Zack & I started in the spring.

I’ll need to finish adding all of the meta data for the bands we’ve thought of thus far before I spend more time improving the visual experience. So far, I’ve spent about 8 hours working on this and will need at least 8 more.

## [In-browser stack](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn/319baaa48243a80a7b70)

Boilerplate files using [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [Sass](https://github.com/medialize/sass.js), [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.com), [Moment](http://momentjs.com), and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) from [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com).

Still need to add examples for Moment and try other libraries like [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) and [nanoScroller](http://jamesflorentino.github.io/nanoScrollerJS).

## [Menu, Pages + Dialogs UI](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn/251d5e9fa2ac422b1940)

Experimental responsive web interface I spent the past 2 days building to solve some issues I have having with another project.

I want to add basic states (working, empty, and fail) and explore adding support for any number of pages in series.

## [Relative gist files](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn/c346c8689a5eaf86e823)

I was having issues referencing separate files in other gists, so I created this to test different methods.

No plans to continue working on this.
