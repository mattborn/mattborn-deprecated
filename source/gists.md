# Gists

## [Bands.](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn/6351a34d29250ecd4519)

An initial stab at prototyping [the music project](http://mattborn.github.io/media/#music) Zack & I started in the spring.

I’ll need to finish adding all of the meta data for the bands we’ve thought of thus far before I spend more time improving the visual experience. So far, I’ve spent about 8 hours working on this and will need at least 8 more.

## [Menu, Pages + Dialogs UI](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn/251d5e9fa2ac422b1940)

Experimental responsive web interface I spent the past 2 days building to solve some issues I have having with another project.

I want to add basic states (working, empty, and fail) and explore adding support for any number of pages in series.
