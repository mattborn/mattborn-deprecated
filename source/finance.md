## Food

Daily food budget inspired by Level.

[Level](https://levelmoney.com) is a personal finance app I have been trying out for the past month in lieu of [YNAB](http://youneedabudget.com). It’s approach to budgeting is based on these 3 configurations:

- Monthly income (I used a fixed dollar amount)
- Expenses based on recurring transactions it suggests from your account history
- Percentage (or dollar amount) you want to save

From there, it follows Warren Buffet’s rule to “spend what is left after saving” by giving you a daily spending amount. That’s it. No categories, manual entry or adjustment lines. You can also view weekly and monthy amounts with a target line to help visualize where you stand, but the daily “left-to-spend” is most helpful.

After putting in a ton of time and effort into YNAB and seeing very little change in our spending habits, my assumption is that the simple at-a-glance of where you stand might be a better motivator for behavioral change. Of course, I don’t yet have enough data or experience to speak with any degree of certainty, and I still agree with all of [YNAB’s principles](http://www.youneedabudget.com/method).

That said, Meg and I found the most difficult category to plan and budget around is food. This includes groceries, fast food, restaurants, convenience stores, street vendors, coffee and drinks. We also created separate categories for when we ate with friends or family and not by ourselves, but that made things too complicated and didn’t really help with decision making while “rolling with the punches.”

I’ll explain my solution with a simple thought experiment. Say your goal was to spend up to $20 a day for 2 people to eat all meals for that day. Quick math would tell us our weekly, monthly, and yearly budgets are $140, $600, and $7,300, respectively. After a weekend with family, we see our daily budget has jumped to $28 per day for that week. For the next several weekdays, we eat cheap and get our daily average back under $20. This is practical, simple and effective. Since meal slots will already be a part of the calendar, integrating this financial logic should be easy.
