# Blog

## URL Format

It was either an essay by [C.S. Lewis](http://cslewis.wikispaces.com/C.+S.+Lewis+Essay+Collection+and+Other+Short+Pieces) or [Mark Twain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Decay_of_the_Art_of_Lying) where I first noticed the convention of the word “On” being used as the first word in the title of a short essay. To this day, the convention has not lost it’s appeal, so I am incorporating it into the URL format for each blog post. Taking another cue from my good friend, [Mig](http://mig.io), each URL will read in plain English in a manner similar to this example:

```
mattborn.com/writes/on-business
```

Feel free to follow suit on your blog.

## Topics

Though I have spent much time thinking deeply and writing casually on many topics, most of these efforts were never published or shared in a measurable or helpful way. While this may be normal, I have an unceasing desire to publish more and cover as much as I can that may be helpful to others. An irrational fear of public opinion and the misguided prioritization of platform over content have prevented me from realizing this goal, but I intend to change this in the coming days.

My main topics will be user interface design, web development, personal health (including the quantified self), technology, philosophy, finance, relationships, leadership, media, business, real estate, travel, food, beer and Chicago. Other topics might include writing, public speaking, [big business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_business) ([data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data), [media](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Media), [banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(banking)), [oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Oil), [advertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising), [soda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_soda)), government, politics, legislation, criminal law, religion (as a sub-category of philosophy), science fiction, French bulldogs, Rubik’s cubes, DIY projects, lucid dreaming, etc.

## Configuration

While I do plan to write some simple, traditional, flush-left, single-column posts, I don’t necessarily want to be confined to a single format or style. I want my “platform” to support custom styling on an opt-in, per-post basis as well as custom dependency stacks to create data-driven visualizations or other experimental concepts that go beyond linear text and images. For now, I could use [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/mattborn) + [bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/mattborn), and later figure out how to include custom dependency stacks in the build process.
