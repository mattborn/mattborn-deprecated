# Philosophy

It is not immediately clear to me how I might effectively organize my thoughts regarding personal philosophy or present my interpretations of other philosophies, but I find it difficult to substantiate anything I have done or will do without attempting to piece together the fundamentals that shape the way I think and make decisions. Maybe there is a method to the madness after all? Or, perhaps, the madness exists only in the dysfunctional desire to [over-analyze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) and over-complicate the method to perpetuate some arbitrary, intellectual void?

Either way, I will first try outlining possible systems for evaluating each disparate ideal in hopes of constructing meaningful associations.

## Trichotomies

For a long time now, I’ve held quite the affinity for systems that exist as, or can be quantified by, a [trichotomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotomy_(philosophy)). <del>While it may be short-sighted or forced at times, there is certainly a natural appeal to things classified as an interrelated triad.</del> REWRITE

### Response

All we have in this life is our response. Our will to act, motivation to change, and resolve to endure are all byproducts of moral responsibility—our ability to respond. (Refusing to respond is itself a response.)

- Sanctified

### Conscious

The limitations of conscious as it applies to theology.

### Worldview
