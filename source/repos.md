# Repositories

## [blog](https://github.com/mattborn/blog)

Simple, pure PHP blog engine I wanted to use to accomplish many of the same things I have since learned to accomplish with [Assemble](http://assemble.io).

No plans to continue working on this.

## [code](https://github.com/mattborn/code)

Compiled this to showcase some of my code when I was looking for jobs a couple years ago. There may be some gems in here.

This was actually a pretty good idea, so I hope to add to this at some point.

## [craiglist](https://github.com/mattborn/craiglist)

Reverse engineering of the [free classified listing service](http://craigslist.com) to recreate the HTML & CSS while I mentored Yurij at [The Starter League](http://starterleague.com).

No plans to continue working on this.

## [hustles](https://github.com/mattborn/hustles)

I discovered [this tool](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-contributions) that generates fake commits to draw a custom Github commit history graph, and I used this repo to test it out, but it didn’t work as expected. Serves me right.

No plans to continue working on this.

## [hvstle](https://github.com/mattborn/hvstle)

Rapid development framework using Slim + NotORM that I never finished. Used a v instead of a u because it was trendy at the time. (Svbtle, Svpply, etc.) I like the initial commit message, though:

> Good things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.

No plans to continue working on this.

## [innovation](https://github.com/mattborn/innovation)

Responsive site using jQuery I coded for MCHC. This was one of my favorite projects during my time at Paper Tower.

I would love to move this logic to something more generic and showcase this as portfolio work.

## [juansan](https://github.com/mattborn/juansan)

Grunt-powered static site generator for building web prototypes. Named after my co-worker John who replaced my former co-worker Cobra Kai and I wanted to preserve the Karate Kid theme.

No plans to continue working on this.

## [mattborn](https://github.com/mattborn/mattborn)

Personal site for which I am still trying to create a sustainable workflow. [Assemble](http://assemble.io) and [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) on a [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplet seem promising!

## [mattborn.github.io](https://github.com/mattborn/mattborn.github.io)

This.

## [rikki](https://github.com/mattborn/rikki)

Personal site for my sister. Initial commit message inspired by Oblivion:

> And how can man die better than facing fearful odds... — Horatius, Thomas Babington Macaulay

No plans to continue working on this.

## [something](https://github.com/mattborn/something)

Basically just a PHP markdown compiler for the title of a retrospective essay I wanted to write to bring closure to a 3-year experiment.

> Something: A Case Study on Ineffective Creativity

No plans to continue working on this.

## [spock](https://github.com/mattborn/spock)

Spent way too many hours and headaches getting a crippled version of edge [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) working on virtual shared hosting with no root access. Although I learned a lot, I am so grateful for things like [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku).

## [steveandbritt](https://github.com/mattborn/steveandbritt)

Modern, single-page, wedding microsite using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), [Assemble](http://assemble.io), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), and [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3). Spent a couple nights on this a few weeks ago, and I may invest more time on this in the future.

## [wordpress](https://github.com/mattborn/wordpress)

I was on a kick to automate the maintenance of WordPress projects when I made this, and this is the result of following [this tutorial](http://davidwinter.me/articles/2012/04/09/install-and-manage-wordpress-with-git/). There was a bash script that followed this that didn’t make it to Github, so I need to find that as it was far more valuable.

No plans to continue working on this since I have fallen out of love with WordPress.

## [youtune5](https://github.com/mattborn/youtune5)

My first pure Ruby project to scrape and extract audio from Youtube with help from my buddy [Eric](http://ericcecchi.com).

No plans to continue working on this.

## [z19r](https://github.com/mattborn/z19r)

Fork of my buddy Zack’s personal site that he lets anyone edit. At the very least, I want to update all the styles.
