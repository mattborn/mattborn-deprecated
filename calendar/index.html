<p>My only billion dollar idea. This generation’s most valuable asset will be a proper, intelligent calendar as all things of importance are bound by the fixed, linear scale of time.</p>
<h2 id="the-time-management-paradox">The Time Management Paradox</h2>
<p>It takes time to manage time.</p>
<p>At what point is one able to net positive while spending time to reduce wasted time by assigning pre-determined value to every available moment? Is procrastination a condition of human nature or the result of conditioning by our culture and its values? A proper calendar must be intelligent, having the ability to use every available resource to increase in reliability while reducing user input.</p>
<h2 id="finances">Finances</h2>
<p>Time is money because we are accustomed to selling our time to earn money, but time has intrinsic value that is much more valuable than any amount of money anyone could ever earn. The catch is that our generation has far more opportunities for richer life experiences than ever before in history. At the end of the day, dining, entertainment, travel, and a standard of living that protects and provides for you and your loved ones costs money. Since science has proved wealth is directly proportional to health and mortality, the same paradox above applies. My belief is that a proper calendar is the most appropriate place to track and manage money both in the short- and <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2012/mass-affluents-a-new-target-niche.html">long-term</a>.</p>
<h2 id="divide-and-conquer">Divide and Conquer</h2>
<p>If a proper calendar can help anyone successfully manage their time and money, the idea is that everything else can and should be quantified and generously invested into. Relationships, communities, charities, opportunities to lead, 
hobbies, and personal development will all benefit as a result of simply having your <del>priorities straight</del> shit together.™ Become a better spouse, parent, friend, neighbor and citizen through intentional, focused, and informed decision making.</p>
